# Community Store Nexi

This package is for the Community Store package for ConcreteCMS.

It lets you accepts payments with [Nexi](https://www.nexi.it/), with the [X-Pay Web implementation](https://developer.nexi.it/it/api/introduzione) (for Intesa Sanpaolo bank customers) or with the [X-Pay implementation](https://ecommerce.nexi.it/specifiche-tecniche/) (for other customers). 

## Testing

In order to test the X-Pay Web implementation you don't need to do anything: this package provides sample test credentials.

To test the X-Pay implementation you'll instead need to create a free account [in the Nexi test portal](https://ecommerce.nexi.it/area-test).
